# Flex-E-Rex-Soldering-Kit

## About
Flex E Rex is a beginer friendly soldering project developed as educational content within the Schulich School of Engineering Makermuliplex and Zetta by Lee Evans and Connor McNeill. The contents of this repo allow for anyone to assemble these kits for themselves.

## Versioning Explained

It is always recommended to use the highest versioned PCB and enclosure files. The below information is just to explain the versioning system used. 

**#.X.X** - Indicates assembly versions. Mostly variations in size or major design changes.

**X.#.X** - Indicates PCB versions. This can be found on the back of the PCB as a "V0.X" needs to match the enclosure parts. 

**X.X.#** - Indicates eclosure part versions. 

**Note:** Any parts with matcing #.#.X versions will be compatible.

Example: *2.2.1* is assembly version 2 with PCB version 2 and enclosure parts version 1.
